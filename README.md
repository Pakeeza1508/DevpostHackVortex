Of course. A good README.md file is essential for any project. Here is a simple but complete guide that you can save as README.md in the root of your project folder. It covers everything from prerequisites to running the application.

Dental Quest: AI-Powered Dental Education Platform

Dental Quest is an interactive, full-stack web application designed to make learning about dental health fun and engaging. It features AI-powered tutoring, interactive lessons, quizzes, and challenges.

Tech Stack

Backend: Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, Groq AI

Frontend: React, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS

Package Managers: Pip (Python), Yarn (JavaScript)

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python (version 3.7+ recommended)

Node.js (version 18+ recommended)

Yarn (If you don't have it, install it globally by running: npm install -g yarn)

MongoDB Atlas Account: A free account for the cloud database.

Groq AI Account: A free account to get an API key for the AI tutor.

Setup and Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
Step 2: Backend Setup (Python & FastAPI)

We will use a Python virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

Create and Activate the Virtual Environment

From the project's root directory, create the environment:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
# On Windows
py -m venv venv

# On macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv

Activate the environment:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with (venv).

Install Backend Dependencies

Install all required Python packages using pip:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

Configure Environment Variables

Navigate to the backend directory.

Create a new file named .env.

Add the following content to this file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

code
Env
download
content_copy
expand_less
# backend/.env

# Get this from MongoDB Atlas (see documentation)
MONGO_URL="mongodb+srv://your_user:your_password@your_cluster.mongodb.net/"

# This will be the name of the database created in your cluster
DB_NAME="dental_quest_db"

# Get this from your Groq AI dashboard
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"

# This is required to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend
CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000"
Step 3: Frontend Setup (React & Yarn)

Navigate to the Frontend Directory

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
cd frontend

Install Frontend Dependencies

Use Yarn to install all the packages listed in package.json.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
yarn install

Configure Environment Variables

In the frontend directory, create a new file named .env.local.

Add the following line to this file. This tells the React app where to find the backend API.

code
Env
download
content_copy
expand_less
# frontend/.env.local

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

(Optional) To fix common development server warnings, you can also add these lines:

code
Env
download
content_copy
expand_less
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=0
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
Running the Application

To run the application, you must have both the backend and frontend servers running at the same time. You will need to open two separate terminal windows.

Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the project's root directory.

Activate the virtual environment: .\venv\Scripts\activate

Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
uvicorn backend.server:app --reload

Your backend API is now running at http://localhost:8000. Leave this terminal open.

Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Application

Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend

Start the React development server:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
yarn start

Your default web browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000. The application is now running
